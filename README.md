## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first challenge. I have coded in a day, because I already work with Frontend Development. But this is my first step to create the habit of make challenges and help the community.

### Continued development

I work with Vue. In Vue it's easy to use CSS pre-processors. But I really would like to learn and apply here the use of SCSS in code without a framework of JavaScript.
